## Description
This project is a new practical item of my mobile code challenges that made with native RN components and:
 - react native v0.65.1
 - [stack-navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/) - (to make transitions between screens)
 - [react-navigation/material-bottom-tabs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/material-bottom-tab-navigator/) - (material-design themed tab bar on the bottom)
 - [react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) - (to persistent key-value data from redux store)
 - [react-native-elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) - (UI Toolkit for RN apps)
 - [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) - (UI buttons and logos)
 - [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) - (To binding layers, read data from Redux store, dispatch actions and store them to update state)
 - [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) - (To persist and rehydrate the redux store)
 - [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) - (Middleware for Redux)
   
 - Of course, I used things like custom hooks, components, navigator and Redux to manage context app data.
